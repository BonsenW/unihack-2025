# UNIHACK 2025

Hi there team!!

Okay, so i created the backend with just `npm init` and frontend with `npx create-react-app`.

## Frontend

Make sure your in the frontend directory. You can run:

- `npm start` to run the app without the backend
- `npm run build` to build the app for production (and to test with the backend)

## Backend

Make sure your in the frontend directory. Simply serves any `/build` files from frontend

You can run

- `npm run dev` to start the backend

## How to run

1. `cd frontend`
2. `npm run build`
3. `cd ..\backend`
4. `npm run dev`
5. Click the localhost link in terminal.
